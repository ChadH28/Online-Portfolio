          <p>An eager, motivated and a business-minded person who always looks for positivity and a way to
            improve, whether it's in certain skills or my continuous character development. My love for
            laughter and time with family and friends are my key interests and they my motivation to be
            better every day.
            I like problem solving and visual imagery, that's why I have a strong liking towards gaming and the
            gaming development of that side as well. it's such a spectacle of seeing some code actually
            translating to a work of art.</p>
